# C++ Media Player (Basic)

This is a simple C++ media player project demonstrating the use of basic C++ features, including file handling, audio/video playback simulation, and object-oriented programming.

## Features

- Basic media player functionalities
- Written in C++ (standard C++11)

## How to Run

Since this project does not include a full media framework, you can:

- Compile and run the code on any C++ compiler
- Use online compilers like [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler) or [Replit](https://replit.com/languages/cpp) to test

## Future Improvements

- Integrate real multimedia libraries (e.g., FFmpeg)
- Add GUI support
- Expand codec support
